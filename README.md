# Obsidian MacTagger Plugin

This plugin is now just drafts (or proof of concept) of an idea that has been spinning in my head for a long time. "What if I sync Mac OS (iOS) tags with Obsidian tags?".

**Warning**: Anything you do yo do at your own risk! Please test plugin on sandbox before use on your prod vault. Or do backup :)

## Works now
- Two commands:
	1. `Write Mac OS tags` - wrtie all tags (frontmatter and body) from current Obsidian note as mac os file tags.
	2. `Write Mac OS tags for current folder` - some as previsoly but for all file in current folder.

## To-Do
- Sync tags while file saved.
- Setting options overwrite or not existing mac os tag.
- Setting options with tags list allowed for sync. Maybe black/whit list.

## Contribute 
I will be grateful for any contribution!
